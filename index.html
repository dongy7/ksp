            ### Synopsis
            - Takes place in the Kerbol planetary system, with Kerbol as the central body
              orbited by 5 planets and 2 dwarf planets.
            - Player controls space program operated by Kerbals, a race of small green humanoids
              who inhabit the planet Kerbin.

            ### Gameplay
            - Players build spacecraft from a provided set of components.
            - After building, players can launch their craft from the launchpad or the runway.
            - Direct control in all three dimensions.
                - Little assitance other than a stability system.
            - During flight map mode is used to track the orbit or the trajectory of the current craft and to get information
              on other spacecraft and planetary bodies.

            ### Game Modes
            - Sandbox
                - Players can attempt any mission without any punishments for failure.
            - Science
                - Initial selection of parts is limited.
                - More advanced parts require "Science" acquired through experiments.
            - Career
                - Contracts to acquire funds for new parts.
                - The number and quality of contracts affected by the player's reputation.

            ### Physics
            - Every object except celestial bodies under control of a Newtonian dynamics simulation.
            - Trajectories and orbits simulated using patched conic approximation to the n-body problem.
            - The astronauts have physics calculations applied to them during EVA (extra vehicular activities).
            - Simulations accurate enough that real world techniques such as Hohmann transfers and aerobraking viable for navigation.

            ### Thoughts
              - Learning Curve
                - No knowledge of rocket science required.
                - Gradually introduced to concepts through trial and error.
                  - Even without understanindg of the physics, players
                    can observe and gain intuition on why something isn't working.
                - Persistance and ability to grasp new concepts.

            ### Thoughts
              - Presentation
                - Does not feel like a traditional cold and dry simulaton.
                - Clumsy Kerbals bring heart and and element of slapstick.
                  - Helps bring the physics down to layman's level.
              - Goals
                - No end goal other than completing tech tree
              - Real Solar System
                - Kerbol system is scaled down for gameplay
                - No stock support for exploring solar system
